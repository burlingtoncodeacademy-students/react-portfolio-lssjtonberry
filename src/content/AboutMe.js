      <p>
        Born in New Jersey. Grew up in Pennsylvania. Went to college in Indiana.
        Spent time in Tennessee and now living in Vermont. In my short time on
        this Earth I can say with some confidence that I've not only been
        around, but that I've had the pleasure of experiencing a cornucopia of
        diversity; something that I feel is important now more than ever in
        today's. It is because of those experiences that I chose to pursue a
        career in development. I seek to find ways to help bring us together; to
        allow people opportunities to see and experience life outside their own
        personal bubbles. How you might ask? With the POWER OF THE INTERWEBS.
        One day I'd like to build webpages and maybe even games to help broaden
        people's minds; give them realistic tools to help guide understanding of
        different cultures outside in ways that speak to their own
        experiences. Not only this, but I want people have fun while doing it! {" "}
